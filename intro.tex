Why CVNN?

Page 38 akira 2012
 In CVNNs, the flexibility in learning and self-organization
is restricted rather than that in double-dimensional real-valued neural net-
works. As we discussed in Section 3.2.1, the restriction is brought by the four
fundamental rules of arithmetic in complex numbers (especially multiplication as it entails rotation and scaling, not just scaling as in real valued case). Such fundamental rules
in processing often work well in solving real world problems. This feature is
one of the most useful advantages in CVNNs. wave-related phenomena
such as sonic wave, lightwave, and electromagnetic wave.4

In short, in CVNNs, we can reduce ineffective degree of freedom in
learning or self-organization to achieve better generalization characteristics.

 if we know a priori
that the objective quantities include “phase” and/or “amplitude,” we can re-
duce possibly harmful portion of the freedom by employing a complex-valued
neural network, resulting in a more meaningful generalization characteristics\\

physical meaning of radar magnitude and phase? discernibility lies in them?

biological motivation
historical uses
success with PolSAR
