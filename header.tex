%ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
Complex numbers are aptly used to describe natural phenomena: wind (speed and direction), electromagnetic waves, MRI data etc. However, CNNs are dominated by the use of real numbers. If we aim to better exploit the camplex-natured data in order to improve the classsification, the CNN should be able to process the complex data. In this work, we explore the design choices and challenges faced while working with $\mathbb{C}$-CNNs. We propose the architectures of and compare the performance of $\mathbb{C}$-CNN and $\mathbb{R}$-CNNs on a synthetic data set (MNIST+P) and two real world radar-datasets. The results are inconclusive to establish the relevance of $\mathbb{C}$-CNNs.
