The incorporation of complex-valued blocks in the classification of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data has been very promising. 

Inspired by the success of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) in computer vision, H\"{a}nsch and Hellwich (2009) \cite{hansch2009classification} employed the $\mathbb{C}$-CNNs to classify the complex-valued Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) data to perform a 3-class classification (forest, fields and urban areas). The authors test there architectures using different error functions for $\mathbb{C}$-CNNs, and compare $\mathbb{C}$-CNNs with their real-valued counterparts. The results conclude that $\mathbb{C}$-CNNs outperformed $\mathbb{R}$-CNNs in that particular problem.

Zhang $et \ al.$ (2017) \cite{polsarzhang2017complex} leverage magnitude as well as the phase of the PolSAR data to classify different terrains on the Flevoland (3 classes) and Oberpfaffenhofen datasets (15 classes). Compared to $\mathbb{R}$-CNN, $\mathbb{C}$-CNN performs better on both the datasets while having approximately same number of parameters.  



Chiheb $et \ al.$ (2018) \cite{trabelsi2018deep} compare the performance of different architectures of the $\mathbb{C}$-CNNs and $\mathbb{R}$-CNNs on the tasks of image recognition, music transcription, and speech spectrum prediction. $\mathbb{C}$-CNNs were reported to perform comparably to $\mathbb{R}$-CNNs for the first task, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the two tasks while beating $\mathbb{R}$-CNNs. The authors also contribute the extension of Batch Normalization and Weight Initialization (BN) to complex domain.
