\chapter{Future work}
We propose the following avenues to explore in order to further explored the results:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Experiment with other real world complex-valued datasets e.g.  Polarimetric SAR data, fMRI data, etc. to further explore the suitability od $\mathbb{C}$-CNNs to complex-valued data
	\item As the performance of the non-Holomorphic activation functions is unpredictable, one can experiment more activation functions in order to determine their suitability for certain problems.
	\item Explore different architectures with different real-valued complex loss function and initialization schemes that can help in convergence of the $\mathbb{C}$-CNNs
	\item In this work, generalization performance was not tested due to limited size of the dataset for deep learning. Any extension of this work should employ fairly large dataset to be able to compare the overfitting characteristics of $\mathbb{R}$-CNNs and $\mathbb{C}$-CNNs 
	
\end{itemize}
